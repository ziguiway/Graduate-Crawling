"""Model adapters. Each adapter returns a DecisionResult.

Every adapter exposes the same probabilities-over-exact-labels interface:
  * TypeSafe-compatible /v1/systemone (native typed interface).
  * The list-shaped /decide flavour some open rebuilds ship (also native).
  * A Gradio demo Space, when that is a rebuild's only public interface
    (still the model's own softmax, only the transport is the demo form).
  * An open-weights checkpoint loaded in-process (native softmax, no network).
  * OpenAI-compatible chat completions with JSON-schema-constrained output;
    the distribution is VERBALIZED by the model (we ask it to emit
    probabilities). This is explicitly NOT logprobs.

No silent fallback: if the endpoint URL/model/key is missing or the response
is unusable, the adapter raises and the runner records a failed attempt.
Raw provider responses are preserved by the runner, not here.
