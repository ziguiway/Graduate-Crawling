"""Deterministic, scalable maze decisions with complete geometric observations.

Only the Python standard library is used. Generation/labels may use graph search;
render_request reads geometry and legal one-step transitions only. No distances,
reachability labels, optimal actions, or other metadata enter model observations.

An action distribution is a *policy*: uniform over all shortest-path actions.
It is not the probability that a random future event occurs. Reachability and
distance-bucket questions instead have deterministic, one-hot truth labels.

Source groups identify D4-equivalent wall layouts, ignoring agent, goal, seed,
and topology names. Builders must keep each group in one split. split_for_state
provides a deterministic default; make_record also supports a builder's frozen
group-level assignment. The existing training loader checks group isolation.
